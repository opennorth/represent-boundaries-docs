title: Using Represent Boundaries
---

Represent Boundaries is a web service allowing you to easily perform queries on geographic boundaries. For example:

* Submit a latitude and longitude to find the administrative area that contains it
* Render a map of school districts in your region
* Find boundaries that intersect or touch another boundary

Represent Boundaries provides a command-line tool to easily load geospatial data into the API. It's a Django app that's easy to integrate into your own project or to deploy on its own as an independent web service.
