title: Use the API
---

You can explore the API starting from `/boundary-sets/`. You'll see links to each boundary set's details and links to browse each boundary set's boundaries. Add `?format=apibrowser` to the end of the URL so that you can click on links and explore the API easily. If you find your way to an individual boundary's details, you'll see links to get its shape and centroid.

For all API documentation, including filters and geospatial queries, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/reference/">read the API reference</a>.

Next, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/manage/">learn how to update and manage you data over time</a>.
